Description: The application will store events and be able to read events based off a matching date.
             There is a function for creating events with the required information being: month, day,
             year, time(HR), time(MIN), and name of event. Another view will be requiring the month,
             day, and year to search for events on that date.
Known bugs: None at this moment.
